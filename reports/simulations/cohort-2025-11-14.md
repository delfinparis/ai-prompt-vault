## Recommendations
- [Quality Meter] Highlight missing timeframe with a subtle nudge and a one-click “Next 30 days” chip. — Shift users over the 65 threshold earlier; better strategy specificity.
- [Onboarding] Reduce perceived friction—relabel the first step and add “Takes ~60 seconds” microcopy. — Lower Step 1→2 drop-off by 2–3 points.
- [Admin Dashboard] Track 45/65/85 thresholds over cohorts; alert when 65+ dips below target for 48h. — Keeps quality regressions visible during iterations.
