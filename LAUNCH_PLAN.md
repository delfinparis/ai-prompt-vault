I know you're busy closing deals, so I'll keep this short.

I built a free tool that gives you 129+ AI prompts specifically for real estate agents. Not generic ChatGPT stuff – actual prompts that help you write listings, emails, social posts, and more.

**Takes 30 seconds to try:**
[Link to app]

Click a prompt, fill in your details (city, niche, etc), paste into ChatGPT. Done.

Already 100+ agents using it. Would love your feedback.
